# AO1-5512
The purpose of this assignment is to load the California housing dataset, write code to produce a boxplot of the data and save a .png file of the boxplot, all within the A01-5512 repository on GitHub. 

The data used in this assignment is the California housing dataset. 

How to run the boxplot.py script on your computer:

# install the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# change the working directory to the A01 repo
cd path/to/A01-5512 

# run the code
python src/boxplot.py

# mac version
python3 src/boxplot.py

The expected output is a saved boxplot image in the figs folder of the A01-5512 repository. It contains boxplots for 9 different numeric variables.
